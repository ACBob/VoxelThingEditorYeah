# VoxelThingEditorYeah
Official Map Editor for VoxelThingYeah.

## What was this?
This was an experimental map editor for VoxelThingYeah, intending to allow you to perform large mapping tasks without opening the game.
However, that was a silly idea for a voxel-based game that has Minecraft features, so it fell through.
This repository still has some interesting oddities in it, though;

 * A map format idea I'd had, and is partially implemented
 * A (bad) level of detail system for chunks
